                    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                    <p>A hip, upstart design firm with <span class="special">infinite</span> possibilities. Infinitry began as two kids in middle school messing around with web design. Those two kids, Tommy Graves and Brandon Carroll, had no idea what they were getting themselves into.</p>
                    <p>After entering high school, they made their first attempt to start a web business, called Generation Studio. They made a website, distributed business cards, and tried to get the word out. But aside from a few small jobs from friends and family, they really didn't get enough business to sustain Generation Studio. That's when they decided to take things in a new direction.</p>
                    <p>They -- we -- decided to start researching. We looked at what worked for other people. We looked at what didn't. We found small people with big ideas and incorporated those into our business model. And we learned more than we ever imagined we would. Today, we are Infinitry.</p>
